    Pet shops treat puppies, kittens, birds, hamsters, mice, rabbits, and other animals as if they were fashion
    accessories and sell them to anyone who plunks down a credit card. Selling animals denies homes to homeless and
    unwanted animals who await adoption in animal shelters.

    Most animals sold in pet stores come from mass-breeding facilities called puppy mills, where they are denied
    socialization, exercise, and veterinary care. The puppies are typically taken from their mothers at an early age,
    packed into crates, and trucked or flown hundreds of miles to brokers and then to pet stores, often without adequate
    food, water, or ventilation. Some puppies don’t survive the grueling journey.

        Conditions at many pet stores are inadequate at best; at worst, they are outright abusive. Puppies are often
        kept in wire-bottomed cages; small animals such as mice, hamsters, gerbils, and rats are often crammed en masse
        into small, filthy, crowded cages; fish who were meant to swim freely in their ocean, lake, or river homes are
        reduced to circling the same few cubic inches of water in tanks that are often dirty and crowded; and exotic
        birds are typically kept in tiny cages, which prevents them from satisfying their natural needs to fly and
        socialize with others of their own species.

        Deprived of regular, loving human contact, puppies and kittens bought at pet stores are notoriously difficult to
        socialize and train. Compounded by the fact that, unlike good animal shelters, most pet stores don’t bother to
        screen potential animal adopters, this means that many animals who are purchased on a whim by unprepared people
        end up at animal shelters.

        A pet shop or pet store is a retail business which sells different kinds of animals to the public. A variety of
        animal supplies and pet accessories are also sold in pet shops. The products sold include: food, treats, toys,
        collars, leashes, cat litter, cages and aquariums. Some pet stores provide engraving services for pet tags,
        which have the owner's contact information in case the pet gets lost.
